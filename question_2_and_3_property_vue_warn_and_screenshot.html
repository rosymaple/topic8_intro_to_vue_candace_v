<h1>Question 2 - Property ... was accessed during render,
  but is not defined on instance.</h1>
<p>
  This warning message cannot be ignored because
  total was not defined in the app. "total" was never initialized,
  but was used within the program. Things that can cause this
  include spelling errors or
  forgetting to include property in return function.
